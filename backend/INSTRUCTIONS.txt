1.Install the necesary requirements: "pip install simplegmail"

See here for more info : https://github.com/jeremyephron/simplegmail

The only setup required is to download an OAuth 2.0 Client ID file from Google that will authorize your application.

This can be done at: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials. For those who haven't created a credential for Google's API, after clicking the link above (and logging in to the appropriate account),

    Select/create the project that this authentication is for (if creating a new project make sure to configure the OAuth consent screen; you only need to set an Application name)

    Click on the "Dashboard" tab, then "Enable APIs and Services". Search for Gmail and enable.

    Click on the Credentials tab, then "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".

    Select "Desktop Application" when asked what kind of application this will be and give it a memorable name.

    Back on the credentials screen, click the download icon next to the credential you just created to download it as a JSON object.

    Save this file as "client_secret.json" and place it in the backend directory. (The Gmail class takes in an argument for the name of this file if you choose to name it otherwise.)


3. Open a terminal window in the backend dir and do : "python simplegmail_setup.py --noauth_local_webserver".

It will ask you to open up your browser to a specific url and get a verification code. Follow the instructions on screen until you get the verification code.

4. Paste it into the terminal. You should see a "gmail_token.json" file appear in the backend directory. At this point, kill the simplegmail_setup.py


5. You now have everything necessary to try "simplegmail_wrapper.py" which is the PoC. Edit the "<youremail>@gmail.com" and "<receiver_email>@gmail.com" in "simplegmail_wrapper.py", save and run!
